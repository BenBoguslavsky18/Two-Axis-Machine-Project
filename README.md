# W23_Two_Axis_Project
This project was done during the 3A Winter term in my Mechatronics Engineering Program. I worked with a two axis machine and programmed its control with an STM32, leveraging course concepts such as interrupts, low-level GPIO configuration (e.g., open-drain outputs for signal control), as well as interfacing with hardware components using C to control the machineâ€™s positioning based on potentiometer input at variable speeds, enabling high-precision motion control.


## Authors and acknowledgment
Some source code for this project was adapted from the Microsteping Motor example for the Nucleo F401RE board provided by STM.
